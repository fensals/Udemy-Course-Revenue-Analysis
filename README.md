# Udemy-Course-Revenue-Analysis

This project is an analysis of course revenue data for the e-learning platform- Udemy.

Traditional methods of education have experienced drastic changes within the last couple of years.
As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and huge strides being made in terms of technological advancement, 
more and more people are embracing online education.

The analysis of past data on courses was done to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and also to track the performance of these courses.

The analysis was done using Microsoft excel and visualized in Tableau.
